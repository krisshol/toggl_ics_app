# Heroku app that uses an .ics file to trigger time entries in Toggl

The app is being developed for my own use. I put it public so people attempting similar projects could find my ad-hoc code and improve on it.

The project makes use of: 

- https://github.com/PuloV/ics-golang
- https://github.com/jason0x43/go-toggl

***Note:** One file is missing here, .env, as it includes my personal information*
